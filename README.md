# FedoraMigrate [![Version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/projecthydra-labs%2Ffedora-migrate.png)](http://badge.fury.io/gh/projecthydra-labs%2Ffedora-migrate) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/projecthydra-labs/fedora-migrate.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/projecthydra-labs/fedora-migrate)

Migrates content from a Fedora3 repository to a Fedora4 one.

## Status

This has been tested against Penn State's existing Scholarsphere applications, as well as generic Sufia applications.
Other uses are presently unknown.

## Overview

FedoraMigrate iterates over your existing Fedora3 application using the Rubydora gem. For each object it finds, it
creates a new object with the same id in Fedora4 and proceeds to migrate each datastream, including versions if
they are defined, and verifies the checksum of each. Permissions and relationships are migrated as well but using
different procedures due to the changes in Fedora4.

The entire migration process takes place in two steps. In the first, all objects, including datastreams and permissions,
are copied over to Fedora4; in the second, relationships are migrated.

## Requirements

1. A working Hydra application using Fedora4
2. An existing Fedora3 instance
3. All models defined in your Hydra/Fedora4 application

## Usage

Add the fedora-migrate gem to your existing Fedora4-based Hydra head

    gem 'fedora-migrate'

Then run `bundle update`

Create a `config/fedora3.yml` file and point it to your current Fedora3 repository

    development:
      user: fedoraAdmin
      password: fedoraAdmin
      url: http://localhost:8983/fedora3
    test:
      user: fedoraAdmin
      password: fedoraAdmin
      url: http://localhost:8983/fedora3
    production:
      user: fedoraAdmin
      password: fedoraAdmin
      url: http://localhost:8983/fedora3

Create a rake task to migrate your repository. You can use the following, taken from `lib/tasks/fedora-migrate.rake`,
as an example:

``` ruby
desc "Migrate all my objects"
task migrate: :environment do
  results = FedoraMigrate.migrate_repository(namespace: "mynamespace", options: {})
  puts results
end
```

Where `mynamespace` is your Fedora 3 pid namespace.

Run the task

    $ bundle exec rake migrate

By default, messages are logged to your Rails environment logs.

## Configuration

FedoraMigrate uses your existing Hydra/Fedora4 application as the basis for migrating objects. For example,
given the model

``` ruby
class MyModel < ActiveFedora::Base
  contains "content", class_name: "ActiveFedora::File"
  contains "thumbnail", class_name: "ActiveFedora::File"
end
```

When the migrator finds an object in your Fedora3 repository that has the name _MyModel_ it attempts to instantiate the
object `MyModel` in the context of your Hydra application. Only the datastreams, or files, that are defined in the model will
be migrated from Fedora3. This means if your Fedora3 object has the datastream "special" but it is not in your Hydra
model, it will not be migrated. DC datastreams are not migrated by default, and RELS-EXT and rightsMetdata datastreams are treated
differently. See [FedoraMigrate::RelsExtDatastreamMover](lib/fedora_migrate/rels_ext_datastream_mover.rb) and
[FedoraMigrate::PermissionsMover](lib/fedora_migrate/permissions_mover.rb).

If your model contains a file or datastream that is versioned, then all versions of that datastream will be migrated from
Fedora3. If the model does not define something as versioned, yet the Fedora3 datastream is versioned, then only the current
version will be migrated to Fedora4.

### RDF Conversion

If you elect to do so, FedoraMigrate will attempt to convert ActiveFedora::NtriplesRDFDatastream objects into RDF properties
defined on your object. You can configure this as an option passed to the migrator.

``` ruby
FedoraMigrate.migrate_repository(namespace: "mynamespace", options: {convert: "descMetadata"})
```

However, you are required to define any and all RDF properties on your object in Hydra. For example, given

``` ruby
class RDFObject < ActiveFedora::Base
  property :title, predicate: ::RDF::Vocab::DC.title do |index|
    index.as :stored_searchable, :facetable
  end
  contains "content", class_name: "ActiveFedora::File"
  contains "thumbnail", class_name: "ActiveFedora::File"
end
```

If your descMetadata RDF datastream in Fedora3 contains the triple

    <info:fedora/mynamespace:xp68km39w> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title> "My Title" .

Then FedoraMigrate will define that property on your Fedora4 object using the DC term.

### Object Migration

By default, FedoraMigrate will use [FedoraMigrate::TargetConstructor](lib/fedora_migrate/target_constructor.rb)
to find a model in your Hydra application that matches
the Fedora3 source object. The constructor is designed to work with Hydra applications. If need be, you can override this
class by creating a new one that determines a model name based on your own criteria.

``` ruby
module FedoraMigrate
  class TargetConstructor

    attr_accessor :candidates, :target

    def initialize candidates
      @candidates = candidates
    end

    def build
      # set target to whichever model you need based on candidates
      return self
    end
  end
end
```

You can also opt to provide your own model, if you wish, by passing it as a second argument to the object mover class.

``` ruby
source = FedoraMigrate.source.connection.find("mynamespace:rb68xc089")
mover = FedoraMigrate::ObjectMover.new source, CustomObject.new
mover.migrate
```

### Configuration Hooks

Because the migration process will be different for each user, overridable methods are placed before and after each step in the
migration process. These can be used if your source or target objects need additional preparation before they can be
migrated. A good example is in Sufia, where a depositor must be applied before the object can be saved.

To use the hooks, simply define them in your migration task

``` ruby
module FedoraMigrate::Hooks

  # Both @source and @target are available, as the Rubydora object and ActiveFedora model, respectively

  # Apply depositor metadata before you migrate an object
  def before_object_migration
    xml = Nokogiri::XML(source.datastreams["properties"].content)
    target.apply_depositor_metadata xml.xpath("//depositor").text
  end

  def after_object_migration
    # additional actions as needed
  end

end

desc "Migrate all my objects"
task migrate: :environment do
  results = FedoraMigrate.migrate_repository(namespace: "mynamespace", options: {convert: "descMetadata"})
  puts results
end
```

## Testing

Execute `bundle exec rake` to run the test suite.

    $ bundle exec rake jetty:clean jetty:start
    $ bundle exec rake fixtures:load
    $ bundle exec rspec

This will run all the spec tests and leave jetty running if you wish to run specific tests.

If you have sample objects that you feel should be used as relevant testing examples, please add them to
`spec/fixtures/objects` and re-run the tests. Sample objects should be exported from existing Fedora3
repositories as foxml files using the "archive" option. This can be done via the admin web interface,
[http://localhost:8983/fedora3/admin](http://localhost:8983/fedora3/admin), or using
`FEDORA_HOME/client/bin/fedora-export.sh`.

*Note that the script option may only work under full installs of Fedora3 and not hydra-jetty.*
